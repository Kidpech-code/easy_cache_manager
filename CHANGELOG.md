## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-14

### Breaking changes
- Replace Hive 2 with Hive CE for working JavaScript/WASM persistence. Direct
  Hive imports and adapter registration must migrate; storage box/type/field
  identifiers remain unchanged. See MIGRATION.md.
- Require Dart >=3.4.0 and Flutter >=3.27.0.

### Fixed
- Select native network/storage implementations only when dart.library.io is
  available; remove unsupported dart:html/dart:io imports from shared storage.
- Stop JSON writes from resetting the global Hive storage directory.
- Resolve development dependencies on modern Dart and replace a missing test
  mock with isolated real storage tests.
- Make the example web-buildable, remove unused dependencies/missing assets,
  and update its deprecated form API.
- Add native legacy-data compatibility tests, JavaScript/WASM browser storage
  tests, and CI release-build checks.
